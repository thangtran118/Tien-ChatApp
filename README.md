📘 Python Multimedia Chat System (TCP + UDP)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Python-based Multimedia Chat System that supports:

  ✅ Multi-client text messaging  
  ✅ Private messaging (PM)  
  ✅ Group / Room messaging  
  ✅ File sharing  
  ✅ Voice notes  
  ✅ Real-time audio calls  
  ✅ Real-time video calls  
  ✅ Active users list  
  ✅ Dark-mode GUI  
  ✅ Hybrid TCP + UDP architecture

It uses TCP for control, messaging, and file transfer, while UDP is used for real-time audio and video streaming to ensure low latency and smooth performance.
The Tkinter-based GUI makes it easy to communicate, create rooms, share files, and start audio/video calls — all inside one application.

⚙️ Technologies Used
* Python
* Socket Programming (TCP & UDP)
* Multithreading
* Tkinter (GUI)
* OpenCV (Video Streaming)
* SoundDevice (Audio Processing)
* NumPy & SciPy (Media Processing)
* JSON (Data Communication)

🧠 How It Works
🔷 TCP is used for:
* Text messages
* File transfer
* Room creation / join / leave
* Call signaling (request, accept, reject, end)
* User registration
* User list updates

🔶 UDP is used for:
* Live audio streaming.
* Live video streaming.
* This hybrid model makes the system:
  * Fast ⚡
  * Stable 🧱
  * Suitable for real-time communication 🎥🎧

🗂️ File Structure
* Chat-System/  
  │  
  ├── Chat_Server.py      # Main server file (TCP + UDP)  
  ├── Chat_Client.py      # GUI Client with audio/video support  
  └── README.md           # Project Documentation

🛠️ Required Libraries
Install these before running the project:
* pip install sounddevice scipy numpy opencv-python
Note: tkinter, threading, socket, json are built into Python.

🚀 How to Run
🔹 Step 1: Start the Server
  * Open terminal and run:
    - python Chat_Server.py
    - Server will start listening on:
      - TCP → 9009
      - UDP → 9010
🔹 Step 2: Start the Client
  * In a new terminal:
    - python Chat_Client.py
    - Then enter:
      - Server IP: 127.0.0.1 (or LAN IP)
      - Port: 9009
      - Username: your desired name
      - Click Connect to Server
